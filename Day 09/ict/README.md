# 🏢 Department Management System (Spring Boot + JPA)

This is a simple **Department Management System** built using **Spring Boot** and **Spring Data JPA**. The application manages departments and their associated employees, providing RESTful APIs to perform **CRUD operations** on departments.

It follows a clean **MVC architecture**, separating concerns across **Models**, **Repositories**, **Services**, and **Controllers**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Add, update, delete, and view departments
- Each department can contain multiple employees (One-To-Many relationship)
- Structured and layered Spring Boot project
- JPA for ORM with PostgreSQL/MySQL/H2 compatibility
- JSON serialization/deserialization with proper reference handling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Hibernate**
- **Jackson (for JSON handling)**
- **Maven**
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 (you can configure any)**

### 2. Configure `application.properties`

Update your `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database settings:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

App will run on: `http://localhost:8080`

* Mapped using `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne`
* JSON references managed via `@JsonManagedReference` and `@JsonBackReference` to avoid infinite loops

---

## 🗂️ Future Improvements

* Add full CRUD for `Employee` entity
* Integrate Swagger UI for API documentation
* Add pagination and filtering
* Add authentication & authorization
